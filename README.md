## ArrayList
An arrayList is a resizable array implementation of the list interface. Unlike arrays in Java, which have a fixed size, an arrayList can change its size dynamically as elements are added or removed. 

```
int [] arr = new int[10] //array declaration which has fixed size
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); //ArrayList declaratio which has dynamic size

//list creation
list.add(1)
list.add(2)
list.add(80)
System.out.println(list.get(2)); // will display the number which is positioned in index 2. OUTPUT: 80

```
